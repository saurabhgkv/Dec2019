I booked Ilford (London) hotel for 6 nights starting 25th Dec,2017 using my international debit card from India. My account was debited for an amount equivalent to £388.50.
However, I was asked to pay the whole amount again at the time of check in on 25th Dec, which I paid full in cash.

It has been more than 2 weeks and I have still not received my money back which was debited from my account at the time of online booking. Since I paid full amount in cash during check in, please refund the money debited from my account during online booking i.e. £388.50.
